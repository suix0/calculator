A calculator made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The way the calculator works is similar to how the iPhone calculator works.

Notable features:
- Can string several operations at the same time.
- Supports changing a number's sign, from positive to negative and vice versa. A number's sign won't be changed unless a number is inputted.
